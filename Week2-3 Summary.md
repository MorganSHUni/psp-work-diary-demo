### Issues
- No one showed up for the planned 7/02/2025 meeting
- Deeshan, Ebrahim, and Abdirizak didn't help Brendon with the wireframing like they were supposed to
  - Deeshan was sick, so that is understandable, but it really just seems that the other 2 aren't putting in as much work
  - Will have to think about this after the sprint
- Personal issue - I find myself unwilling to communicate with my team - will have to think of ways to combat this, because I can't just get tired and ignore them - thats not good teamwork
