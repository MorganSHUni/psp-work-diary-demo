## Week 1 
(20/01/2025 - 26/01/2025)

### Overview
In the week starting with 20/01/2025, we completed:
- Functional requirements (Morgan)
- Non-Functional requirements (Morgan)
- Use cases (Billy)
- User personas (Billy)
- Established GitHub and Discord

### Future Planning
Due to our better understanding of the system after our interview with Davina, we decided to redo part of our requirements specification.
As such, by the end of the week starting with 27/01/2025, we hope to complete:
- Reevaluate Functional requirements (task given to Morgan)
- Reevaluate Non-Functional requirements (task given to Morgan)
- Reevaluate Use cases (task given to Billy)
- Reevaluate User personas (task given to Billy)
- Complete User stories (task given to Billy)
- Complete Class diagrams (task given to Morgan)
- Complete flowchart map of the system (task given to Deeshan)

### Issues
We had trouble meeting with our old teammates, and eventually we got reassigned.
Billy forgot to turn up to our friday 24/01/2024 meeting, but issue was quickly resolved, as we discussed it, and agreed he'd complete the use cases and user personas.
