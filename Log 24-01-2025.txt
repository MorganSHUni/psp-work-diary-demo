It's currently 13:31 and Billy has not shown up to the meeting - which was supposted to start at 13:00.
I've texted him on Discord multiple times - including the room I'm currently in (9310), and he hasn't replied or given me any indication that he's read them.
I'm going to stay and do the work I planned on, and email him a report of what happened after I'm done.
I haven't heard anything from the other group mates, so I'm assuming they also aren't coming.
This lowkey kinda sucks honestly.

I haven't done any work since monday unfortunately, I was working on my personal research/projects, so I'm going to focus on researching the company, completing functional + non-functional requirements, etc.

Morgan:
- Must Have:
  - functional requirements
  - non-functional requirements
- Should Have:
  - Use cases
  - User stories
  - User personas

13:50 - moving all these files to the proper forked repository
