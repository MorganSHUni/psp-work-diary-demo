It's currently 13:31 and Billy has not shown up to the meeting - which was supposted to start at 13:00.
I've texted him on Discord multiple times - including the room I'm currently in (9310), and he hasn't replied or given me any indication that he's read them.
I'm going to stay and do the work I planned on, and email him a report of what happened after I'm done.
I haven't heard anything from the other group mates, so I'm assuming they also aren't coming.
I haven't done any work since monday unfortunately, I was working on my personal research/projects, so I'm going to focus on researching the company, completing functional + non-functional requirements, etc.

Morgan:
- Must Have:
  - functional requirements
  - non-functional requirements
- Should Have:
  - Use cases
  - User stories
  - User personas

13:50 - moving all these files to the proper forked repository

15:50:
In an effort to refine the non-functional requirements and get a metric to measure NFR01 (security), I have gone down a rabbit hole that took me far longer than I thought it would.
Currently, I am making a document to define the security metrics and assessment (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AcVTgHvXqp-ZvOyYtTTHAFNFgJKYjXj8pv7RjZ2GKe8/), which should help us make the test cases later on, but in doing so, it is taking me a long time, which may mean that I will not be able to complete the use cases, stories, or personas soon.
As such, I think I will leave the security metrics document to another day (maybe try to finish it by the end of next week), and I will focus on finishing the non-functional requirements - though they may be vague while I finish the metrics doc. With the non-functional requirements done, I should be free to complete the use cases, user stories, and user personas by the end of the week.
I did succeed in adding more functional requirements with the MoSCoW organisational system (see "functional requirements 24-01-2025" - everything that is circled in red has been added), and I have run out of ideas as to what could be a requirement. While we are waiting for an interview with the client, I will have to talk to Billy to see if he has any.
Speaking of Billy, he hasn't shown up, nor contacted me. Neither has any of the other group members. I've emailed them, so we'll see if they respond.
